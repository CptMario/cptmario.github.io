                <p style="font-size: 16px;">
                  BIIIIIIIIIIIIIITCH, HOW DO I TELL U THIS, TODAY WAS A HELL OF A DAY, bro, i know its bc of ur period, but damn, my heart, my brain and everything, couldn't handle are ur love bitch holy 
                  shit HAHAHAHHAHA i fucking loved it. I can spend my whole life talking to u, and not getting bored a single second with someone as you. Perb, u are my person, u are my world, u are evertything
                  and in 20 days, u showed that, it's true it scared the hell out of me, but i dont fucking care, amma take the risk, amma risk it all, i dont care, imma give to you everything i have. It
                  took me only 20 days(acc less) to realize how perfect u are for me. Every cute world u say to me, every smile u give to me, every feels like a dream when im with u, and i dont want to
                  wake up from that dream, only if its bc u told me to wake up and go kiss u.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 16px;">
                  My feelings for u, are not even close to anything i have felt before, already told you that, every time u say something about that u talked about me to someone, it makes me 
                  feel so special, like if im someone important, and i know u already told me that, and i should trust u on that, and i do bitch, but well, this things just makes me feel much better.
                  My life without you now will feel so empty, like something is missing, and i dont wanna feel that any day, not in a long time. I already told u on call, but i've never been so sure 
                  of something in my entire life, as im sure that i wanna spend my whole life with you and give all i have to you. I want you to trust me, and i wanna trust you my fullest. No secrets, 
                  no hidding anything (well, having secrets its okay HAHAHAHAH but i mean like secrets and things that can hurt our relation).
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 16px;">
                  I'm so grateful that u explained to me all that stuff about ur past, ur mother things, and ur past loves and everything, it mades me feel you even more and trust you even more. You are 
                  a fucking strong girl, with a big heart and much love to show, thats why im not going to leave u anywhere soon, and i wanna spend as long as u let me of that road that is called life
                  with you beside me. Im not going to lie, but i think today we spent like 10 hours talking bc my insta says 6 hours, and scener + discord are like 4 HAHAHHAHAHA so imagine bitch, 10 fucking
                  hours and i will spent 10 more. I wanna say with everything i have, that i fucking love you so much, just take it the way u want to take that, and my heart and cake, are all yours. 
                </p> 
                <p style="font-size: 16px;">
                  I've spent my entire life 
                  looking for the perfect girl, but what is perfect for me, might not be perfect for everyone. Everyone wants someone to talk about sex, I want someone who I can talk about 
                  aliens, superpowers, clothing, weridstuff and love.. So can you give me the pleasure to say to you, that IT'S YOU I COULD LOVE, ACCTUALLY? (that's not the answer to be my gf dont 
                  worry HAHAHAHAH)
