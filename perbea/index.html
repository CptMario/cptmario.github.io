                <p style="font-size: 16px;">
                  OMG I was checking the previous message I wrote to you here, and it was fucking cringey, for when we did 1 MONTH TOGETHER, and look at us now, we are almost 9 months into our relationship.
                  Also, in 2 fucking weeks we going to see each other for the first time, it's amazing how time flies with you. Sometimes you really get the worst out of me, and u make me so stressed and so mad at you
                  but im proud of how far u have accomplished and how much u growed in this period of time. You are really different from the Perbea i started dating. And i like it, for real, i like the girl
                  that im watching right now, and where she's going.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 16px;">
                  Life is not easy, sometimes it brings you joy but mostly it gives you hard times. Slowly u are learning how to deal with those, and how to work harder to don't let that problems affect you so much,
                  (still a lot of work to do bitch) but you're getting to it. I know I don't tell you this that much, but i'm really proud of you gordita, every time something good happens to you, my body is full of joy, 
                  you really deserve the best of the bestests, you are trully amazing and have tought me a lot. It always looks like im the one teaching, but thats not true, u have tought me a lot, from selfcare and selflove,
                  to not being selfish with some stuff. Life is a learning, and im so glad that i can learn this life besides you.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 16px;">
                  Mi amor, i can't imagine living this life without you, at this moment u are the most important part of my life, you my pillar, my course, you guide me throught this life. So cari√±o it's ur 21th birthday,
                  but what i hope is that in 21 years more, we can still be together, and even better, closer to each other (tbh i hope that happens in 1 year), i wanna be with you every 18 of this life, every first day of the month,
                  to every last day, just wakey2 besides you and watching ur ugly morning face waking up to the sun rising. Put some music in the morning, shower together, breakfast together, and just doing our life, TOGETHER.
                  The only thing I need in this life is you bbita, i don't need anything more, just you and me, for ever. With that, my life will be fullfiled, i don't care where this life will bring us, but as long as I'm with you, 
                  i will take any challenge, and any place that it drives us.
                </p> 
                <p style="font-size: 16px;">
                  To end this gordita, te amo muchisimo, happy birthday bby I hope u will have a better day than those 2 last days, and u have a lot of fun. U are amazing and i love you so fucking much. Never leave me.
