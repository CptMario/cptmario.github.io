                <p style="font-size: 16px;">
                  So, as i told you I had another surprise ready for today, I didnt wanted to send this to you till after the 28 of Nov at 5pm, bc thats when we started talking, thats the day
                  you told me "Yoo", the first message, and the first word of our relationship, that was the start of everything. And look at us now, we both together, we are boyfriends, and 
                  we are discovering what is having a serious relationship together. For me, this also new, because i never had that feeling before, that feeling of true love, such as the love
                  you can have with ur parents, the fucking true love that makes you feel safe and in home. Thats the feeling I have everytime I see you, and I dont know, i could never have 
                  expected to meet someone on an App and feel that thing. I could never have expected to meet my soulmate on a stupid application such as TanTan, but here we are, FUCKING BOYFRIENDS.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 16px;">
                  I have enjoyed every single moment i've spent with you, even the bad moments, bc with all of them makes us what we are now. Even that moment when we thought that was over, it was
                  made u take the decision to be with me, and u really felt the true love at that moment, so we can say that we are here thanks to that low moments in our short time. But now,
                  everything is going in the right direction and now we both know what we want from each other, and expressing that feelings, so we can keep growing and improving the relationship. 
                  Because, if we want to keep going with this, and on a LDR, we need to trust in each other, and say what we feel. And im sure this is going to work if we keep doing like that.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 16px;">
                  And so proud to call you my girlfriend now, and really i feel like im in a dream with you, it all feels so perfect and so amazing that my heart is going to explode HAHAHAHA. 
                  Yesterday night was one of the best moments in my life, telling you all my feelings and all i told you was amazing, even tho i was drunk, all that i said was true and what i feel,
                  i want to do everything we talked, from the chuchu stuff, to traveling, to discovering the earth together and discover our passions together, ALL OF THAT, TOGETHER.I love that u 
                  make me feel so special, talking about me to ur friends, dad, mom and everyone, it feels so good and so special being with you.
                </p> 
                <p style="font-size: 16px;">
                  As i told you before, i love seeing you fighting with ur hair, smiling, sneaking to watch me on discord and taking videos of us, its just amazing, and everyime i see you i just feel
                  like i have won the lotery with you. Every message, every single word we exchange, it just makes me feel so appreciated, and i know that sometimes i dont take ur compliments, i mean bby,
                  i take every one of the compliments, but its just that I underrate myself, so i dont think that way, but obvisuly i appreciate it and i feel loved when u tell me that things, so keep 
                  doing it and dont surrender with me. You dont have to care for any other girl, because why i would change the best girl in the universe for someone that is clearly worse. You don't need
                  to worry aboyt that because im yours and u are mine, so im not even worried for ur guys (well maybe a little but slowly HAHAHAHHAHA) I WANNA BE YOURS SO BAD (U KNOW WHAT I MEAN ;) ).
                  But babe, now we are officially 1 month together, and im not drunk, lemme ask you the question again. 
                </p> 
                <p style="font-size: 16px;">
                  Perbea, do you wanna be my girlfriend? Wanna make ur dreams come true, while we are together? Because i want to. I love you so much my everything.
                </p>
