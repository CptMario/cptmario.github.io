                <p style="font-size: 16px;">
                  Goood morning my beautiful girl. I think today i feel so inspired to create something beautiful in today's letter hahahahah, so lets try. Mi amor, I feel so happy and so 
                  grateful being able to call you my girlfriend. I've said it a lot of times, but amma say it again, you don't even know what u mean from me, in 6 days we gona be 1 month since 
                  i know you, and i couldn't ask for a better month at you side, we been talking for HOURS every day, and spent my whole time with you, and i can't say anything other than that
                  every minute i've spent with you have been the happiest i've been in a long time, every night, i go to sleep thinking about you, thinking about us, thinking about the desire i have to
                  see you, touch you, feel you, kiss you, and explore with you, and i fall asleep with the biggest smile someone can have, bc im with the best person possible.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 16px;">
                  I could never imagine falling in love with someone so far away from me, with such a different culture and everything, but someone with whom i have a lot in common as you Perbea. 
                  Distance sucks its true, not being able to see you in person hurts a lot, but we can overcome this as we doing. We need to keep trying to do different activities till im able to
                  travel to Philippines, bc if u really think im not going, u dont know me HAHAHAHAH, ill be there the first one. Bitch, u kinda right im impulsive, its true, but im impulsive bc
                  i feel really comfort doing this stuff for you, im not saying just bc im crazy, i am crazy but im also in love, i could never do this stuff for someone that is not worth. And what can i 
                  say, im a fucking crazy romantic bitch, so be ready for that stuff, bc amma keep doing this stuff, even when we are 30 years together (bc we gona be together for all our life or at least
                  i hope so hahahahah)
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 16px;">
                  I have said this a lot of times too, but my feelings for you are not even close to anything i felt before, and i just know that if i work hard for this relationship it can last long, so 
                  im going to try my best, give you all i got and im going to leave my whole soul for this relationship. Amma be true to you okay? Im going to explain a bit of me. Before knowing you, i had 
                  no hope for any relationship at all, I was really heartbroken. As you know i had 3 relationships, 1 was useless, just pointless, the other i got cheated on i was heartbroken and couldn't 
                  be on a relationship or anything for more than a year, and the last one was broken bc we didnt connected. I felt like i was doing everything bad, then i met you. This beautiful, perfect 
                  and smart girl, with everything on her so special and unique that gave me a reason to keep believing in love. You don't know how much u helped me with everything, and thats why I 
                  don't want to regret anything with you, I'm going to give all I have for you, amma be the best version of myself, just for you.
                </p> 
                <p style="font-size: 16px;">
                  This is being a hell of a long message HAHAHAHAHA im going to end it here. Bitch, i cant wait for keep discovering you, all your secrets, slowly, hope i can keep discorering more, 
                  I don't know if u have more little or big secrets you have to tell me, but if u have, dont be scared of telling me, you know u can trust me, just when u are ready i hope u will 
                  tell me all of them. I havent told you in all the letter that i love you, but i think it keep pretty clear what my feelings are, i know sometimes im a bit clingy with too much 
                  I love you, and too much cringe stuff that i say to you, i know it can be too much and be annoying, but thats who i am HAHAHAHAHA a clingy bitch. I love you so much my love, for 
                  more days to come.
