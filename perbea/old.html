                <p style="font-size: 16px;">
                  GOOOOD MORNING PERBEEEEAAA. Hope ganahan mo sa twist. I'm running out of ideas HAHAHAHHAHA but well as long as is with you, I'm sure the ideas will keep coming. Bitch u inspire me
                  so much you can't even know, for me you are like my muse, bautiful, smart and funny. You can't imagine what are my feelings when I'm around you. As you once told me, "you drive me crazy,
                  but not in a bad way, or like  psycho way, but in a good way". I know this letter is not much different from the others, its just a text and the same, but well, it took me more time just 
                  to make the design of the page, and the idea HAHAHAHAH but well, at the end the important is the message, what im saying and that I always think about you, as I told, since I wake up
                  till I go to sleep I keep thinking about you (AND EVEN SLEEPING, OK DONT THINK ITS RATED 18 BITCH, SOMETHING CUTE).
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 16px;">
                Bitch, your letters just hit different, they are so damn cute, and so damn beautiful, I close my eyes once i finished reading them and I imagine I'm with you. I know today is gona be
                a weird day, because we are not gona do videochat or anything, and i've been used to do it, I'll miss it for sure. But well, even tho, i will keep an eye to the mobile, just to see if
                you told me something so i can answer you. I'm not gona forget you just because i'm with my friends or so, yes they are my friends, but you are really special for me, so if i can, i will
                talk to you (AND YES, DONT WORRY ABOUT IT IF I DO IT ITS BECAUSE I WANT TO, SO DONT TELL ME TO FOCUS ON MY FRIENDS, I CAN DO BOTH).  OH BTW DID YOU TOLD UR FRIEND ABOUT ME?? IM CURIOUS HEHE.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 16px;">
                  I know you like to look like you are a rock, but thats not true, or at least, not with me. You haven't showed that to me at all, you are really sweet, really caring and everything. So 
                  its not a bad thing to sentir mariposas en el estomago. Don't try to hide them its something good and meaningful for us. I can say, that i see you as someone that really dont want to go 
                  fast because you feel like maybe it can hurt you, so thats why u maybe try to hide a bit some of these feelings, but don't do it pls, trust me more than you do now. Bitch im not going to
                  hurt you.. Bitch i love how careful u treat me, yesterday was a bit awkward at first with ur brother, because u were talking and didnt understand anything so i was feeling a bit like 
                  i didnt belong there. But when u started talking me on IG i really felt ur love. BITCH I WILL MAKE U FEEL THE HAPPIEST PERSON IN THE WORLD SO STAY WITH ME AND LETS GROW TOGETHER.
